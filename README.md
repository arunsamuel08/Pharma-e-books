<h1> PHARMA E-BOOKS </h1>

Pharma E-Books is a react-based web application built by me to facilitate the easy access of notes and books for my college students. It provides books of B-Pharmacy, which can be easily accessed by a simple search. The notes section provides curated notes of each semester of B-Pharmacy. The simple UI makes it easy to navigate through both books and notes.
